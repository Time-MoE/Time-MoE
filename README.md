## Introduction

Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only time series foundation models with a mixture-of-experts architecture,
designed to operate in an auto-regressive manner, enabling universal forecasting with arbitrary prediction horizons and
context lengths of up to 4096.

## ðŸ“š Training Data

Time-300B dataset is available on [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Maple728/Time-300B)!

Here's an example of how to use this dataset:
```python
import random
from time_moe.datasets.time_moe_dataset import TimeMoEDataset

ds = TimeMoEDataset('Time-300B')
seq_idx = random.randint(0, len(ds) - 1)
seq = ds[seq_idx]
```

This code snippet shows how to load a random data sequence from the Time-300B dataset. First, download the dataset to the local 'Time-300B' folder, import the TimeMoEDataset class from time_moe.datasets, instantiate the class, and finally retrieve a sequence using a random index.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install Python 3.10+, and then install the dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Time-MoE requires `transformers==4.40.1` .**

2. [Optional but **recommended**] Install [flash-attn](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) for faster training and inference speeds with reduced memory usage.

```shell
pip install flash-attn==2.6.3
```

### Making Forecasts

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

context_length = 12
seqs = torch.randn(2, context_length)  # tensor shape is [batch_size, context_length]

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    'Maple728/TimeMoE-50M',
    device_map="cpu",  # use "cpu" for CPU inference, and "cuda" for GPU inference.
    trust_remote_code=True,
)

# use it when the flash-attn is available
# model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('Maple728/TimeMoE-50M', device_map="auto", attn_implementation='flash_attention_2', trust_remote_code=True)

# normalize seqs
mean, std = seqs.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True), seqs.std(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
normed_seqs = (seqs - mean) / std

# forecast
prediction_length = 6
output = model.generate(normed_seqs, max_new_tokens=prediction_length)  # shape is [batch_size, 12 + 6]
normed_predictions = output[:, -prediction_length:]  # shape is [batch_size, 6]

# inverse normalize
predictions = normed_predictions * std + mean
```

+ If the sequences are normalized already:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

context_length = 12
normed_seqs = torch.randn(2, context_length)  # tensor shape is [batch_size, context_length]

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    'Maple728/TimeMoE-50M',
    device_map="cpu",  # use "cpu" for CPU inference, and "cuda" for GPU inference.
    trust_remote_code=True,
)

# use it when the flash-attn is available
# model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('Maple728/TimeMoE-50M', device_map="auto", attn_implementation='flash_attention_2', trust_remote_code=True)

# forecast
prediction_length = 6
output = model.generate(normed_seqs, max_new_tokens=prediction_length)  # shape is [batch_size, 12 + 6]
normed_predictions = output[:, -prediction_length:]  # shape is [batch_size, 6]
```

### Evaluation

+ Prepare the benchmark datasets.

You can access the well pre-processed datasets
from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NF7VEefXCmXuWNbnNe858WvQAkJ_7wuP/view?usp=sharing), then place
the downloaded contents under `./dataset`.

+ [Example] Running the follow command to evaluate on ETTh1.

```shell
python run_eval.py -d dataset/ETT-small/ETTh1.csv -p 96
```
